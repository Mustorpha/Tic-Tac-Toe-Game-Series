# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Series
A release of  series of back algorithm for utmost gaming strategies in a tic tac toe game, assuming the other player plays optimally.The minimax principle is a decision theory suggested by an Hungarian - American mathematician; John Von Neumann which implies that in a competitive game, each player will act to maximize his minimum gain or minimize his maximum loss, perfect decision on either will result in a win for the winner. It is a powerful theory used to find the best move for a player in a two-person zero sum game where the gain of a player equals the loss of the other, and can get very complex in implementation if proper care is not taken.
